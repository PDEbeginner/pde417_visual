WaveEquation.mThis code demonstrates wave equation on domain x[0:L]. Generates .gif file showing change in the y displacement u for each point on x. Also shows traveling waves with different shapes (sine, triangular, and rectangular). Shows waves traveling right and left, and superposition of the two traveling waves. Spring_mass_system.m	This code demonstrates a wave equation with a spring-mass system at the left end. String_force_left.mThis code demonstrates the motion of a string that is fixed on the right end but has a force applied at the left end. Solves the wave equation as the initial boundary value problem for 1D wave equation. rhs.ode.m	right hand side of ODE a”=-n^2a+qnt in String_force_left.m.
