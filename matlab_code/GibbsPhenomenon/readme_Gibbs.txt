Gibbs.mThis code demonstrates Gibbs Phenomenon. The Fourier Sine Series of f is used where f=0 @[0,pi/2] & f=1 @[pi/2,pi] & f=-1 @[pi,1.5pi]. Difference in the frequencies at n=100 and n=300 is shown as well as the difference in the overshoot at the two jump discontinuities. Gibbs_v1.mMore refined version of Gibbs.mplotFS_Gibbs.mThis function plots gibbs phenomenon. Called by Gibbs_v1.m.
